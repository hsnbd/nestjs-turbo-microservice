TURBO is a community of software developers and tech enthusiasts getting together to help one another out. The software industry relies on collaboration and networked learning. We provide a place for that to happen.
Our application is open source, you can inspect every little detail of the code, or chip in yourself!
We believe in transparency and adding value to the ecosystem. We hope you enjoy poking around and participating.
Tech companies can reach out to their desired candidates from this community.
